				</p>
				<p>
					We now know better about what is needed and where. We don’t just

				<p>Communities are diverse and different…</p>

					But we make sure that no community is left behind in their
					understanding and stance against what is wrong.

				<p>Every man in every community we visit is taught;</p>

						<li>

						<li>
							- how to influence other people to adopt healthy behaviour and

						</li>
						<li>
							- how to take legal action against violators and make sure that
